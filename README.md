Python projects

This repository represents my first Python projects. 

FizzBuzz..............Created 10/31/17. I attended a local Intro to Python class on 10/31/17 where the teacher 
                      mentioned the FizzBuzz challenge. This was not a class exercise but a self-directed project.

Shopping_list.........This was a class challenge for teamtreehouse.com's Python track.

number_game...........This was a class challenge for teamtreehouse.com's Python track. I tried to elaborate on the 
                      base functionality of the app by incorporating a play-again feature and checks against incorrect
                      input types.
              
reverse_number_game...This was a self directed project based on the number_game challenge. I wanted to create 
                      a game where the app guessed at your number, taking too high/low clues from the user.
                      
hangman...............This was a class challenge for teamtreehouse.com's Python track.
